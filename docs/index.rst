Cusisine -- Chef-like functionality for Fabric
==============================================


About
-----

`Fabric <http://fabfile.org>`_ is an incredible tool to automate administration
of remote machines. As Fabric's function are rather low-level, you'll probably
quickly see a need for more high-level functions such as add/remove users and
groups, install/upgrade packages, etc.

Cuisine is a small set of functions that sit on top of Fabric, to abstract
common administration operations such as file/dir operations, user/group creation,
package install/upgrade, making it easier to write portable administration
and deployment scripts.

Cuisine's features are:

* Small, easy to read, a single file :ref:`API`
* Covers file/dir operations, user/group operations, package operations
* Text processing and template functions
* All functions are lazy: they will actually only do things when the change
  is required.


Installation
------------

If you have `setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_
you can use ``easy_install -U cuisine``. Otherwise, you can download the
