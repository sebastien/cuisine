    -- Chef-like functionality for Fabric


About
-----

`Fabric <http://fabfile.org>`_ is an incredible tool to automate administration
of remote machines. As Fabric's functions are rather low-level, you'll probably
quickly see a need for more high-level functions such as add/remove users and
groups, install/upgrade packages, etc.

Cuisine is a small set of functions that sit on top of Fabric, to abstract
common administration operations such as file/dir operations, user/group creation,
package install/upgrade, making it easier to write portable administration
and deployment scripts.

Cuisine's features are:

* Small, easy to read, a single file API: <object>_<operation>() e.g.
  dir_exists(location) tells if there is a remote directory at the
  given location.
* Covers file/dir operations, user/group operations, package operations
* Text processing and template functions
* All functions are lazy: they will actually only do things when the
  change is required.


Installation
------------

Cuisine is on PyPI so you can either use ``easy_install -U cuisine``
or ``pip install cuisine`` to install it. Otherwise, you can download
the source from `GitHub <http://github.com/sebastien/cuisine>`_ and
run ``python setup.py install``.

How to get started
------------------

Open up a python shell and type:

::

    import cuisine

Cuisine is designed to be a flat-file module, where all functions are prefixed
by the type of functionality they offer (e.g., `file` for file operations,
`user` for user operations). The available groups are:

    `text_*`
        Text-processing functions

    `file_*`
        File operations

    `dir_*`
        Directory operations

    `package_*`
        Package management operations

    `command_*`
        Shell commands availability

    `user_*`
        User creation commands

    `group*`
        Group creation commands

    `mode_*`
        Configures cuisine's behaviour within the current session.

    `select_*`
        Selects a specific option, such as package back-end (`apt`, `yum`, `zypper`, or `pacman`)

If you're using an interactive Python shell such as
`IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ you can easily browse the available
functions by using tab-completion.

::

    In [2]: cuisine.file_
    cuisine.file_append       cuisine.file_is_file      cuisine.file_unlink
    cuisine.file_attribs      cuisine.file_is_link      cuisine.file_update
    cuisine.file_attribs_get  cuisine.file_link         cuisine.file_upload
    cuisine.file_ensure       cuisine.file_local_read   cuisine.file_write
    cuisine.file_exists       cuisine.file_read
    cuisine.file_is_dir       cuisine.file_sha256

As the functions are prefixed by they type of functionality, it is very
easy to get started using an interactive shell.

If you would like to use cuisine without using a `fabfile`, you can call the
`mode_local()` function.

::

    import cuisine
    cuisine.mode_local()
    print cuisine.run("echo Hello")

alternatively, you can also directly connect to a server

::

    import cuisine
    cuisine.connect("my.server.com")
    print cuisine.run("echo Hello")

If you want to use cuisine within a `fabfile`, simply create a `fabfile`
with the following content:

::

    from cuisine import *

    def setup():
        group_ensure("remote_admin")
        user_ensure("admin")
        group_user_ensure("remote_admin", admin")

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you are encoutering problems, please check the following:

- The user@host is running an SH-compatible (sh, dash, bash, zsh would work)
- The system has`openssl base64`, `md5sum` and `sha1sum` commands in addition
  to the basic UNIX ones.

If you still have a problem, simply file a bug report
here https://github.com/sebastien/cuisine/issues

Right now, cuisine is tested on Ubuntu. Some contributors use it on RHEL
and CentOS. If you use on a different system, let us know if it works!

Contributing specific implementations
-------------------------------------

Cuisine was originally developed as a Debian/Ubuntu-centric tool, but can
easily be adapted to other distributions or Unix flavor, the only caveat being
that the shell is expected to be bash-compatible.

If you want to implement a specific variant of some functions for a specific
platform, you should do the following:

1) Open the `cuisine.py` source and look for the definition of the function
   that you would like to specialize.
2) If the function is decorated by '@dispatch', it means it already supports
   specific back-ends (see `package_*` functions), and you can proceed
   to the next step. Otherwise, you can either file a ticket on Github
   or read the source and mimic what we've done for `package_*`
3) Create a specific version of the decorated function by creating a new
   function with the same name, suffixed by your specific backend name. For
   instance, if you'd like to create a `yum` backend to `package_ensure`, 
   you would need to create a function `package_ensure_yum` with the same
   arguments as `package_ensure`
4) Once you've created your specific functions, make sure that you have
   a `select_*` matching your function group. For the `package_*` functions,
   this would be `select_package`.
5) Look for the `supported` variable in the `select_*` and add your backend
   suffix to it (in our example, this would be `yum`)

To use a specific backend implementation of a set of features, use the 
`select_*` functions.

::

    # To use the 'apt' backend
    cuisine.select_package("apt")
    # To see the available backends
    print cuisine.select_package()
